# Examining-_Air_Quality_and_Health_Outcomes_in_Lagos-Nigeria
This project analyzes satellite-recorded air pollution data (PM₂.₅, NO₂, CO, SO₂) alongside hospital-reported respiratory cases in Lagos, Nigeria (2018–2024). It explores pollution trends, seasonal patterns, and health impacts, and develops predictive models to forecast respiratory disease surges for better public health planning.
